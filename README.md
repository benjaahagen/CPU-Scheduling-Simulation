# CPU-Scheduling-Simulation

## Repository Contents
- FCFS.py: Implementation of the First-Come, First-Served scheduling algorithm.
- SJF.py: Implementation of the Shortest Job First scheduling algorithm.
- Priority.py: Implementation of the Priority Scheduling algorithm.
- RoundRobin.py: Implementation of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.
- Process.py: Definition of the Process class used in the scheduling algorithms.
- main.py: Main script that runs the scheduling algorithms on a dataset of processes.
- cpu-scheduling.xlsx: Dataset of processes used in the simulations.

## Project Overview
The project involves the creation of Python classes for each scheduling algorithm and simulates their behavior with a dataset of processes. The analysis provides insights into the performance of each algorithm, such as wait times and execution times.

## How to Run
- Clone the repository.
- Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed (openpyxl).
- Run the main.py script to execute the scheduling algorithms on the provided dataset.
